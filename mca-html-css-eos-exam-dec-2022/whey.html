        <p>Functions of protein

            Structure – Protein is a building block of our body tissue and is a structural component of every cell in our body, therefore it is important for growth and repair. It makes up half the body’s dry weight and is the second most abundant compound after water. It is a primary component of muscle, hair, skin, nails, eyes as well as internal organs. Organs such as the heart and gut are made up of muscle fibers as well a skeletal muscle, hence muscle is essential for health as well as overall fitness and strength. Collagen is also a protein which makes up extracellular matrices, essential for bone, joints and cartilage.1</p>
       <h3>details</h3>
       <p>Tryptophan – converted to 5HTP which is then converted to serotonin and then melatonin when exposed to darkness, thereby supporting mood and sleep 3
        Tyrosine – is important to produce thyroid hormone (thyroid hormone is made up of tyrosine and iodine), also the neurotransmitter dopamine which is essential for mood, motivation and movement, dopamine is then converted to noradrenaline
        Insulin – is made from a protein composed of 2 chains
        Enzymes – essential for normal bodily processes including digestion are complex proteins
        Haemoglobin, antibodies and other transport proteins – produced from amino acids</p>
        <h3 class="energy">Energy of suppliment</h3>
        <p >although the body will always favour carbohydrate over protein for energy production, protein can be used as an energy source. Protein is converted to glucose for energy via gluconeogenesis. This process is less efficient than direct carbohydrate metabolism and therefore there is less net gain of ATP (or energy). However, when carbohydrate intake is reduced, protein will be used as an energy source. Also, when energy intake in less than energy output, protein from muscle and other body tissues can be broken down in order to produce energy.2</p></section>
